# FPL Data

This repository contains the resolvers and schemas for a GraphQL endpoint which fetches data from the FPL API.

The data from 11 of the FPL endpoints (listed below) can be queried from this GraphQL endpoint.

It also contains an Express server which is used in my [FPL Planning Tool](https://github.com/JackRogers9/fpl-planning-tool).
This server is used to login to the user's FPL account and make calls which require the user to be authenticated.
